# to_do_app
This is the latest project that I am working on. Programming language is Java. This is a Spring Boot application. For now I have written necessary RESTFUL APIs for back end. I have set up Swagger and connected the back end to local MySql database. There will be new methods that I will be implementing later. The planned next steps:

Work on front end side: create simple web page for my app. I will be using vue.js
Configure security
Testing
Connect frontend and backend
Kubernetes
Sonarqube
I might configure AWS in the future.
